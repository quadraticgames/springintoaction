# Spring Launch Physics Game

## Project Overview
This web-based game/simulation teaches the physics of springs and Hooke's Law by challenging players to launch an object and hit three targets placed at different distances. The simulation takes place on an x-y plane (like a spreadsheet chart) and provides real-time analytics including velocity, trajectory, and current xy position.

## Game Description
- **Objective:**  
  Hit three distinct targets, each positioned at varying distances from the launch point, to win the game.

- **Game Mechanics:**  
  - **Spring Launch:** The player adjusts the spring’s tension (using a slider or input field) to determine the force applied to launch an object.
  - **Physics in Action:** Utilize Hooke’s Law (F = -kx) to calculate the initial force. This force is then used to determine the object's initial velocity and launch angle.
  - **Projectile Motion:** Simulate the object's trajectory using basic projectile motion equations, including gravitational effects.
  - **Analytics:** Display real-time information such as current velocity, the trajectory path on the x-y plane, and the object's current xy coordinates.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Spring Mechanism:**  
  - User controls to adjust spring compression.
  - Animated visual of the spring launching the object.

- **Target System:**  
  - Three targets placed on the x-y plane at various distances.
  - Visual feedback when a target is hit.

- **Real-Time Physics Analytics:**  
  - Display current velocity.
  - Draw the trajectory path on the x-y grid.
  - Show current xy coordinates of the object during flight.

- **User Interface:**  
  - A clean, minimalistic design with a grid layout (like a spreadsheet chart) for the x-y plane.
  - Axis labels and clear presentation of physics analytics.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML5 & CSS3:** Structure and styling of the web app.
  - **JavaScript:** Core logic for interactivity and physics calculations.
  - **p5.js:** For rendering animations, managing graphics, and handling the canvas.
- **Optional Physics Library:**
  - **Matter.js:** For a more robust physics simulation if needed.
- **Development Tools:**
  - Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
  - Live-server or similar tool for real-time preview.

## Implementation Details
- **Launch Mechanics:**
  - **Force Calculation:**  
    Compute the force using Hooke’s Law (F = -kx) based on user input.
  - **Velocity & Angle:**  
    Derive the initial velocity and launch angle from the computed force.
  - **Trajectory Simulation:**  
    Use projectile motion formulas to update the object’s position over time, incorporating gravitational pull.

- **Analytics Display:**
  - **Real-Time Updates:**  
    Continuously update and display the object's velocity, trajectory, and xy coordinates during its flight.
  - **Visual Trajectory:**  
    Render a real-time path (dotted line or smooth curve) showing the projectile's trajectory on the grid.

- **Game Logic & Win Condition:**
  - **Collision Detection:**  
    Monitor when the projectile intersects with a target zone.
  - **Target Hit:**  
    Register a hit when the projectile enters a target’s area.
  - **Win Condition:**  
    Declare a win once all three targets have been successfully hit.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - **Responsive Design:**  
    Ensure the web app functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
  - **User Feedback:**  
    Include sound effects or visual cues (like target highlighting) when a target is hit.
  - **Modular Code Structure:**  
    Organize code into functions/modules for physics calculations, rendering, and UI updates for easier maintenance and scalability.
  - **Testing:**  
    Optionally implement unit tests for critical functions (e.g., force and projectile motion calculations).

## Conclusion
This game combines engaging gameplay with educational content, allowing players to explore the fundamentals of spring physics, projectile motion, and energy dynamics. By integrating interactive controls, real-time analytics, and dynamic visualizations, the simulation provides a hands-on learning experience that deepens the understanding of Hooke’s Law and related physics concepts.
